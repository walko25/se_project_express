# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

In this project I created by first back-end server to work with the What to Wear app we have developed in previous sprints.

## Technologies Used:

Node.js
Express
Mongoose
MongoDB
ESLint

### Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

#### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
